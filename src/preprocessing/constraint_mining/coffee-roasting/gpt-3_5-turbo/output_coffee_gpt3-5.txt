# Constraints for Coffee Roasting Process
In order to understand the constraints related to the coffee roasting process, we need to focus on the key activities and information provided in the descriptive file. The activities we are interested in are: 'Height Measure', 'Moisture Measure', 'Roast Degree Selection', 'Roasting Chamber 1', 'Roasting Chamber 2', 'Roasting Chamber 3', 'Roasting Chamber 4', 'Roasting Chamber 5', and 'Final Measure'. Let's extract the constraints for each activity:

## Height Measure and Moisture Measure
These activities are related to the measurement of coffee pile height and moisture levels. There are no direct constraints mentioned for these activities in the descriptive file. They provide essential data for the subsequent activities.

## Roast Degree Selection
This activity is related to selecting the roast degree for coffee beans. The constraints for this activity are as follows:

c1 = ({Roast Degree Selection}, {Roasting Chamber 1, Roasting Chamber 2, Roasting Chamber 3}, {directly follows}, {Coffee tray height < 180mm => Temperature of Roasting Chamber 1 [120°, 400°], Temperature of Roasting Chamber 2 [220°, 500°], Temperature of Roasting Chamber 3 <= 550°})

c2 = ({Roast Degree Selection}, {Roasting Chamber 1, Roasting Chamber 2, Roasting Chamber 3}, {directly follows}, {Coffee tray height >= 180mm => Temperature of Roasting Chamber 1 [140°, 420°], Temperature of Roasting Chamber 2 [240°, 520°], Temperature of Roasting Chamber 3 <= 571°})

## Roasting Chamber 1, Roasting Chamber 2, Roasting Chamber 3
These activities are related to the first three roasting chambers. The constraints for these activities are as follows:

c3 = ({Roasting Chamber 1}, {Roasting Chamber 2}, {eventually follows}, {Temperature of Roasting Chamber 1 [200°, 560°], Temperature of Roasting Chamber 2 [300°, 660°]})

c4 = ({Roasting Chamber 2}, {Roasting Chamber 3}, {eventually follows}, {Temperature of Roasting Chamber 2 <= 760°, Temperature of Roasting Chamber 3 >= 400°})

## Roasting Chamber 4 and Roasting Chamber 5

c5 = ({Roasting Chamber 4}, {Roasting Chamber 5}, {eventually follows}, {Temperature of Roasting Chamber 4 <= 680°, Temperature of Roasting Chamber 5 <= 580°})

c6 = ({Roasting Chamber 4}, {Roasting Chamber 5}, {eventually follows}, {Temperature of Roasting Chamber 3 >= 421°, Temperature of Roasting Chamber 4 >= 320°})

## Final Measure
This activity is related to the final measurement of coffee beans. There are no specific constraints mentioned for this activity in the descriptive file.

# Description for Coffee Roasting Process Constraints
## Roast Degree Selection
### c1
This constraint specifies the temperature conditions for Roasting Chamber 1, Roasting Chamber 2, and Roasting Chamber 3 based on the selected coffee tray height. If the coffee tray height is less than 180mm, specific temperature ranges must be maintained in each chamber. If the height is equal to or greater than 180mm, different temperature ranges apply.

### c2
Similar to c1, this constraint defines temperature conditions for Roasting Chamber 1, Roasting Chamber 2, and Roasting Chamber 3 based on coffee tray height. It provides temperature ranges for each chamber to ensure the desired roast degree.

Roasting Chamber 1, Roasting Chamber 2, Roasting Chamber 3
### c3
This constraint describes the relationship between the temperature conditions in Roasting Chamber 1 and Roasting Chamber 2. It specifies that Roasting Chamber 2 eventually follows Roasting Chamber 1, ensuring a smooth transition in temperature.

### c4
This constraint extends the relationship to include Roasting Chamber 3, which eventually follows Roasting Chamber 2. It defines temperature conditions to maintain in each chamber for a successful roasting process.

## Roasting Chamber 4 and Roasting Chamber 5
### c5
These constraints outline the relationship between Roasting Chamber 4 and Roasting Chamber 5. They specify temperature conditions for both chambers, ensuring that temperature limits are not exceeded for different coffee tray heights.

### c6
These constraints provide additional temperature conditions for Roasting Chamber 4 and Roasting Chamber 5. They ensure that temperature requirements are met to produce high-quality roasted coffee beans.

Please note that the descriptive file provides detailed information about temperature rules and constraints related to the coffee roasting process, ensuring the desired roast degrees are achieved while maintaining quality standards.

# Coffee Roasting Process Constraints Description
## Temperature Control during Coffee Roasting
These constraints define the temperature control requirements for each roasting chamber in the coffee roasting process. The specified temperature ranges must be maintained during the transition from one chamber to another. Failure to meet these temperature conditions may result in the rejection of the final product.

## Coffee Pile Height and Roasting Chamber Temperature Control
These constraints take into account the coffee pile height and its impact on temperature control in the roasting chambers. Different temperature ranges apply based on the coffee pile height. It ensures that the temperature conditions are appropriate for the given pile height.

## Dark Roast Specific Constraints
These constraints are specific to the dark roast process, introducing additional temperature requirements for roasting oven 4. The temperature ranges must be adhered to for a successful dark roast.

## General Coffee Roasting Constraints
These constraints encompass various aspects of the coffee roasting process, including quality assessment criteria and general temperature control. They ensure that the process follows specific rules and standards.

# Additional Information
## Power Switch
The power switch controls the main power system of the roaster. It must be turned fully on before charging the roaster with green beans. It can also be used as a timer, with different time settings corresponding to different positions.

## Heater Control
The heater control knob adjusts the heater current, affecting the roasting chamber's temperature. It should be adjusted to maintain the desired heat level, as the resistance of the heaters may change during operation.

## Ammeter
The ammeter measures the electrical current flowing through the heaters. It helps monitor and adjust the heater current for precise heat control during the roasting process.

## Blower Control
The blower control knob adjusts the blower level, which has various functions, including air circulation, chaff removal, and cooling of roasted beans. The blower level should be adjusted as needed.

## Thermometer
The thermometer measures bean temperature, providing crucial information for the roasting process. It ensures that the beans are roasted at the appropriate temperature levels.

## Electrical Circuit Breaker
The electrical circuit breaker is a safety feature that shuts down the roaster in case of excessive current draw. If the roaster stops operating, it should be reset by depressing the button. If it repeatedly opens, it indicates the need for repair.
