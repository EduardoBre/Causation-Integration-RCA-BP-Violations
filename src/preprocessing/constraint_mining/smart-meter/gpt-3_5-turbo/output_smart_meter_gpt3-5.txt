To extract relevant business process constraints from the provided descriptive file ('descriptive_file') based on the activities listed in the 'activities_list,' we will analyze the text and create constraints for each relevant relationship. Here are the extracted constraints along with their descriptions:

# Description for a group of constraints
"""
These constraints describe the business process related to the activation and deactivation of the consumption time series display on the meter. They also cover status reporting, synchronization, communication with NB, and logbook entries associated with these actions.
"""
These constraints capture the relationships between activities, the type of relationship (direct or eventual), and the conditions that need to be met for each constraint to be satisfied without violating process rules described in the 'descriptive_file.'
