# Roasting Guidelines for Different Roast Degrees and Coffee Tray Heights

## General Guidelines:
c1 = ({[any roasting chamber]}, {[any roasting chamber]}, {directly follows}, {each roasting chamber takes 5 minutes})

## Light Roast:
### Coffee Tray Height < 180mm:
c2 = ({[Roasting Chamber 1]}, {[Roasting Chamber 2]}, {directly follows}, {(120° < temperature < 400°)})
c3 = ({[Roasting Chamber 2]}, {[Roasting Chamber 3]}, {directly follows}, {(220° <= temperature <= 500°)})
c4 = ({[Roasting Chamber 3]}, {[Final Measure]}, {directly follows}, {temperature = 550°})

### Coffee Tray Height >= 180mm:
c5 = ({[Roasting Chamber 1]}, {[Roasting Chamber 2]}, {directly follows}, {(140° <= temperature <= 420°)})
c6 = ({[Roasting Chamber 2]}, {[Roasting Chamber 3]}, {directly follows}, {(240° <= temperature < 520°)})
c7 = ({[Roasting Chamber 3]}, {[Final Measure]}, {directly follows}, {temperature < 571°})

## Medium Roast:
### Coffee Tray Height <= 170mm:
c8 = ({[Roasting Chamber 1]}, {[Roasting Chamber 2]}, {directly follows}, {(170° <= temperature < 450°)})
c9 = ({[Roasting Chamber 2]}, {[Roasting Chamber 3]}, {directly follows}, {(270° <= temperature < 550°)})

c11 = ({[Roasting Chamber 4]}, {[Final Measure]}, {directly follows}, {temperature <= 550°})

### Coffee Tray Height > 170mm:
c12 = ({[Roasting Chamber 1]}, {[Roasting Chamber 2]}, {directly follows}, {(temperature < 180°) OR (460° < temperature < 1000°)})
c13 = ({[Roasting Chamber 2]}, {[Roasting Chamber 3]}, {directly follows}, {(temperature < 290°) OR (570° < temperature < 1000°)})

c15 = ({[Roasting Chamber 4]}, {[Final Measure]}, {directly follows}, {temperature <= 560°})

## Dark Roast:
### Coffee Tray Height >= 175mm:
c16 = ({[Roasting Chamber 1]}, {[Roasting Chamber 2]}, {directly follows}, {(220° <= temperature <= 580°)})
c17 = ({[Roasting Chamber 2]}, {[Roasting Chamber 3]}, {directly follows}, {(320° <= temperature <= 680°)})

c20 = ({[Roasting Chamber 5]}, {[Final Measure]}, {directly follows}, {temperature <= 580°})

### Coffee Tray Height < 175mm:
c21 = ({[Roasting Chamber 1]}, {[Roasting Chamber 2]}, {directly follows}, {(200° <= temperature <= 560°)})
c22 = ({[Roasting Chamber 2]}, {[Roasting Chamber 3]}, {directly follows}, {(300° <= temperature < 660°)})
c23 = ({[Roasting Chamber 3]}, {[Roasting Chamber 4]}, {directly follows}, {(temperature < 400°) OR (760° < temperature)})
c24 = ({[Roasting Chamber 4]}, {[Roasting Chamber 5]}, {directly follows}, {(320° <= temperature < 680°)})
