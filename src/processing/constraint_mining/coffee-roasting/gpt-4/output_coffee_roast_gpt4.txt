These constraints, derived from the detailed description in the descriptive file, guide the roasting process for different types of coffee (light, medium, and dark) at varying tray heights. They ensure the quality of the coffee by specifying the necessary temperature ranges for each roasting chamber, depending on the type of roast and the height of the coffee pile on the tray. This detailed process control is essential for achieving the desired flavor profile and quality in the final product.
